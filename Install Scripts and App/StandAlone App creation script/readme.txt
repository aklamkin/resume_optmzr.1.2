Finding Your Repository Directory
Run these commands in Terminal to locate it:
bash# Search for the directory by name
find ~ -name "resume_optmzr.1.2" -type d 2>/dev/null

# Or search for any directory containing "resume"
find ~ -name "*resume*" -type d 2>/dev/null

# Or if you cloned it recently, check common locations
ls ~/Desktop/resume_optmzr.1.2
ls ~/Downloads/resume_optmzr.1.2
ls ~/Documents/resume_optmzr.1.2
ls ~/Projects/resume_optmzr.1.2
If You Can't Find It
If the directory doesn't exist on your Mac, you'll need to clone it from GitHub:
bash# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/aklamkin/resume_optmzr.1.2.git

# Or if you don't have git, download and extract manually:
# 1. Go to https://github.com/aklamkin/resume_optmzr.1.2
# 2. Click the green "Code" button
# 3. Click "Download ZIP"
# 4. Extract the ZIP file
Complete Setup Process
Once you find or create the directory:

Navigate to the directory:
bashcd /path/to/resume_optmzr.1.2
# Replace /path/to/ with the actual path you found

Copy the app builder script (from the artifact above) and save it as build_resumeai_app.sh in that directory
Run the builder:
bashchmod +x build_resumeai_app.sh
./build_resumeai_app.sh

Add your Gemini API key to the generated .env file
Test the app by double-clicking ResumeAI.app

The key point is that you need to be in the directory that contains the backend/ and frontend/ folders from your original project. Let me know what you find when you search for it!
