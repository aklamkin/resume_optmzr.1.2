Thank you for the detailed responses. Based on your input and the analysis of the `resume_optmzr_1.2` repository at https://github.com/aklamkin/resume_optmzr_1.2, I’ve finalized a comprehensive, technical, concise, and professional prompt for an AI or human developer to build a state-of-the-art clone of the app. This prompt incorporates all existing features, addresses your requirements, and avoids assumptions by aligning with your confirmed preferences.

### Prompt for AI/Human Developer

**Objective**: Build a state-of-the-art clone of the `resume_optmzr_1.2` application, replicating all existing features (resume upload/parsing, keyword optimization, formatting suggestions, ATS compatibility check, UI, text export), enhanced with modern UI/UX, scalability, security, cross-platform support, accessibility, payment functionality, and best practices for software development. The solution must be deployable on a private Linux host using free-of-charge technologies, with a traditional structure and full documentation for installation from scratch as of 01:48 PM EDT on Sunday, July 20, 2025.

#### Requirements

1. **App Overview**:
   - Develop a web-based resume optimization tool that parses uploaded resumes, suggests keywords for ATS compatibility, provides formatting advice, and exports optimized versions.
   - Target audience: Job seekers, recruiters, career coaches.
   - Cross-platform support: Web (desktop/mobile) with Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities.

2. **Feature Set**:
   - **Resume Upload and Parsing**: Support PDF, DOCX, and TXT uploads. Use `pdf2json` and `python-docx` for parsing, enhanced with `spaCy` for entity recognition (skills, experience) and Hugging Face Transformers for advanced scoring (e.g., resume quality, ATS fit).
   - **Keyword Optimization**: Compare resume content with user-provided job descriptions. Use an expanded keyword database (starting with `keywords.json`, augmented with the latest open-source job keyword datasets from sources like O*NET). Include a weekly update script to refresh the database from the source (e.g., via a cron job or scheduled task).
   - **Formatting Suggestions**: Auto-format resumes with 5+ customizable, industry-specific templates (e.g., tech, healthcare). Use `reportlab` for PDF generation and `python-docx` for DOCX.
   - **ATS Compatibility Check**: Analyze keyword density, formatting issues (e.g., tables, headers/footers), and use Transformers for ML-based ATS readiness scoring (0-100) with detailed feedback.
   - **User Interface**: Modern UI/UX with React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, and Redux. Include a responsive dashboard, dark mode, and WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader support).
   - **Export Functionality**: Export optimized resumes as PDF, DOCX, and TXT, with template selection.
   - **Payment Functionality**: Implement a freemium model with Stripe test mode. Support Google Pay and Apple Pay linked to the user’s login method (Google/Apple accounts). Free tier: 3 resume optimizations/month, basic template. Premium tier: Unlimited optimizations, advanced templates, collaboration features (e.g., shareable links).
   - **Additional Features**: User authentication with “Login with Google” and “Login with Apple” (OAuth 2.0 via `authlib`), English-only support, real-time preview of optimizations.

3. **Tech Stack**:
   - **Frontend**: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, Redux.
   - **Backend**: Flask (Python 3.11) with Gunicorn for production, RESTful API design.
   - **Database**: SQLite with a normalized schema.
   - **Dependencies**: `pdf2json`, `python-docx`, `spaCy`, `reportlab`, `transformers` (Hugging Face), `flask-jwt-extended`, `gunicorn`, `authlib` (for OAuth), `stripe`.
   - **Deployment**: Dockerized with `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` for Nginx reverse proxy and Gunicorn workers.

4. **Architecture and Best Practices**:
   - **Structure**: MVC pattern:
     - `app/`: Main Flask app.
     - `app/models/`: Database models (SQLAlchemy ORM).
     - `app/controllers/`: API endpoints.
     - `app/static/`: Frontend build.
     - `app/templates/`: HTML templates (optional).
   - **Database Schema**:
     - `users`: id (PK, INTEGER), email (UNIQUE, TEXT), oauth_provider (TEXT, e.g., google/apple), oauth_id (TEXT), created_at (DATETIME).
     - `resumes`: id (PK, INTEGER), user_id (FK, INTEGER), file_path (TEXT), parsed_text (TEXT), analysis_json (JSON), created_at (DATETIME).
     - `jobs`: id (PK, INTEGER), user_id (FK, INTEGER), description (TEXT), created_at (DATETIME).
     - `keywords`: id (PK, INTEGER), keyword (TEXT, UNIQUE), source (TEXT), last_updated (DATETIME).
     - Indexes on `user_id` for performance, foreign key constraints.
   - **Security**: HTTPS enforcement (via Nginx), SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries), JWT for session management, OAuth 2.0 authentication, input sanitization, rate limiting (Flask-Limiter).
   - **Scalability**: Multi-worker Gunicorn setup (4 workers), load-balanced with Nginx, cached responses (Flask-Cache).
   - **Performance**: Async processing for resume parsing and Transformer inference (asyncio), optimized database queries with indexes.

5. **Deployment Package**:
   - **Files**:
     - `Dockerfile`: Builds Python environment with dependencies.
     - `docker-compose.yml`: Defines services (app, Nginx, database).
     - `requirements.txt`: Lists all Python dependencies.
     - `package.json`: Frontend dependencies.
     - `setup.sh`: Automates dependency installation and container startup (`chmod +x setup.sh && ./setup.sh`).
     - `update_keywords.py`: Weekly keyword update script (scheduled via cron: `0 0 * * 0 python update_keywords.py`).
     - `README.md`: Detailed setup instructions (e.g., `docker-compose up --build` on Ubuntu).
   - **Steps**: On a fresh Ubuntu host with Docker installed, clone repo, run `./setup.sh`.

6. **Enhancements for "Best Ever"**:
   - **Performance**: Lazy-loaded UI components, CDN for static assets (Cloudflare free tier).
   - **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling readiness with Docker Swarm (optional free setup).
   - **UI/UX**: Interactive drag-and-drop upload, real-time optimization preview.
   - **Accessibility**: High-contrast mode, full keyboard navigation.
   - **Security**: CSRF protection, secure file handling (temp file cleanup).
   - **Additional Features**: AI-driven resume scoring with Transformers, weekly keyword updates.

7. **Monetization**:
   - Freemium model: Free tier (3 optimizations/month, basic template), Premium tier (unlimited optimizations, advanced templates) via Stripe test mode with Google Pay/Apple Pay linked to OAuth login.

#### Implementation Steps
1. **Setup Environment**:
   - Install Docker on Ubuntu: `sudo apt update && sudo apt install docker.io`.
   - Clone repo: `git clone <repo-url>`.
   - Run `./setup.sh` to build and start containers.
2. **Backend Development**:
   - Initialize Flask app with SQLAlchemy models.
   - Implement API endpoints: `/upload` (POST), `/optimize` (POST), `/export` (GET).
   - Add OAuth authentication (Google/Apple) and Stripe integration.
3. **Frontend Development**:
   - Build React app with Vite.
   - Create components: UploadForm, OptimizationDashboard, ExportModal, PaymentModal.
   - Integrate Tailwind CSS and accessibility features.
4. **Database and Security**:
   - Define schema with SQLAlchemy migrations.
   - Apply security controls (e.g., `flask-limiter`, JWT, OAuth).
5. **Testing and Optimization**:
   - Unit tests for parsing and optimization (pytest).
   - Load test with Locust for scalability.
6. **Deployment**:
   - Build and run with `docker-compose up --build`.
   - Verify at `http://localhost` (adjust for private host IP).

#### Deliverables
- Fully functional app with source code, Docker files, and documentation.
- Deployable on a private Ubuntu host with Docker support.
- Open-source tech stack, no licensing costs.
